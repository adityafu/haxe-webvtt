1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,566
FORTY-LOVE!

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,666
THIS IS MATCH POINT.
YOU READY?

3
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,840
FINALLY. LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,800
ACE!

5
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,600
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
GOING EASY ON ME

6
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,400
'CAUSE I'M NEW
AROUND HERE.

7
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,233
EASY? WHAT, THAT WAS BRUTAL!

8
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,266
MY SWEAT HAS SWEAT.

9
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,932
WHAT, ARE YOU SOME KIND
OF TENNIS HUSTLER OR SOMETHING?

10
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,633
FIGURE NEW TOWN,
NEW SCHOOL,

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,999
NEW UNEXPECTING KIDS TO BEAT?

12
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,750
HEY, I DIDN'T TAKE
YOUR MONEY OR ANYTHING.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,216
NO, JUST MY SELF RESPECT.

14
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,000
LOOK OUT!

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,233
DIANA, I TOLD YOU,
FOLLOW THROUGH.

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,200
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE
FOLLOW THROUGH. COME ON.

17
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,833
ANY DAY NOW.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
YOU'RE WELCOME.

19
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,767
Ned: WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

20
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,666
YOU KNOW
DIANA MORRISON?

21
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,700
I USED TO, BACK WHEN I LIVED
IN GRANDVIEW THE FIRST TIME.

22
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,099
WE WERE FRIENDS.
DIANA?

23
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,266
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

24
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,032
IT WAS LIKE A MILLION YEARS AGO. DIANA?!

25
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,633
DIANA? OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?!
DIANA, DIANA! SOMEBODY HELP!

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,899
DIANA!
DIANA, PLEASE!

27
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,233
DIANA!

28
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,600
DIANA, DIANA!
PLEASE WAKE UP!

29
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,867
WHAT HAPPENED?

30
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:34,366
SHE JUST DROPPED
OUT OF NOWHERE,

31
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,333
SHE WON'T RESPOND!
I'M CALLING 9-1-1.

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,433
I'LL STAY HERE.
GO GET HELP.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
DIANA, IT'S OLIVIA.
Coach: OK.

34
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,533
DIANA, PLEASE WAKE UP!
YES, WE NEED AN AMBULANCE.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,333
GRANDVIEW PARK AT THE TENNIS
COURTS. A GIRL'S COLLAPSED.

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,233
DIANA! DIANA!
WAKE UP!

37
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,466
WAKE UP! DIANA!
DIANA, PLEASE.

38
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,032
DIANA, WAKE UP!

39
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,633
WHY WON'T YOU WAKE UP?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,566
<i>DIANA... DIANA!</i>

41
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:00,166
THANK YOU.
SURE.

42
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,767
OH.

43
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,999
THANK YOU, NURSE.

44
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,199
JIM.
HI, DOCTOR.

45
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,400
MELINDA, HOW YOU FEELING?
I FEEL OK.

46
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,733
NO MORE NAUSEA,
LIGHT-HEADEDNESS?

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,733
UM, NO.

48
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,867
WELL...

49
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,767
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.

50
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,566
YEAH, WE-
WE FIGURED AS MUCH.

51
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:20,767
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THE
PREGNANCY TEST SAID, TOO.

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,433
ALL TEN OF THEM.

53
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,099
SO THEN...

54
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,700
EVERYTHING
THAT I WAS FEELING...

55
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,899
IT WAS ALL JUST
IN MY HEAD?

56
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,867
NO, YOU DID CONCEIVE,

57
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:37,433
BUT YOUR BODY DIDN'T
SUPPORT THE PREGNANCY.

58
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:45,433
DOC, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,333
IF YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT YOUR
CHANCES OF HAVING A BABY, DON'T.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,210
THERE'S PLENTY OF TREATABLE
CONDITIONS THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

61
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,466
LET ME RUN SOME TESTS,
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE, OK?

62
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:53,999
OK.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,833
THE NURSE WILL SCHEDULE
YOUR NEXT APPOINTMENT.

64
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,066
THANKS.

65
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,199
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WOW.

66
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,299
I NEVER REALLY FIGURED
IT WOULD BE THIS HARD.

67
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:07,867
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

68
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,767
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS HAPPEN,
TOGETHER.

69
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,899
OH...

70
00:03:12,966 --> 00:03:14,666
YOU NEED TO FINISH
YOUR SHIFT.

71
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,299
GO, I'LL BE OK.

72
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:17,999
YOU SURE?

73
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,500
YEAH.

74
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,466
'CAUSE YOU CAN HOLD ON TO
MY HAND AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

75
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,566
OH! SORRY.

76
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:28,366
I LOVE YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

77
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,199
DOC, BP 75 OVER 42.
COMING IN!

78
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,966
PULSE IS RAPID
AND IRREGULAR.

79
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:48,733
I WANT AN ECG
AND A CHEST X-RAY.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,733
AND GET ME
A CONSENT TO TREAT.

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,199
DO WE HAVE HER NAME?
I'M ON IT!

82
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,899
DIANA MORRISON.

83
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,199
DOROTHY?

84
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:01,299
NED, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

85
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,299
ARE YOU OK?
YEAH.

86
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,700
YEAH, I'M FINE.
WE'RE BOTH FINE.

87
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:05,767
Doctor: ONE, TWO...

88
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,867
GIRL COLLAPSED
ON THE TENNIS COURTS.

89
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,566
OLIVIA AND I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS OK.

90
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:11,199
SHE HAS TO BE OK.
OLIVIA!

91
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,233
MOM!

92
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,066
I WENT TO THE COURTS
TO PICK YOU UP

93
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,400
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE,

94
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,032
AND THEY SAID A GIRL HAD
COLLAPSED! I THOUGHT THAT-

95
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,833
I'M FINE, MOM. I'M
SORRY FOR SCARING YOU.

96
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,466
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

97
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,133
IT'S DIANA.

98
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,333
DIANA MORRISON?

99
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,733
WHERE'S DIANA MORRISON?

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,733
I'M HER MOTHER. THEY
TOLD ME SHE WAS HERE.

101
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,032
OLIVIA?

102
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,366
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

103
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,500
MRS. MORRISON, I WAS
AT THE COURTS WITH NED.

104
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:42,700
DIANA WAS THERE, TOO.

105
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,366
SHE WAS TAKING
A LESSON, I GUESS.

106
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,099
SHE JUST COLLAPSED.

107
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,032
WAS IT HEAT STROKE?

108
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,099
SHE MUST HAVE JUST FAINTED.

109
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,867
SHE BARELY ATE
ANY BREAKFAST.

110
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,133
Diana: NO!

111
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,466
NO!

112
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:04,099
TIME OF DEATH...

113
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TIME OF DEATH?!

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,733
YOU ALL RIGHT?

115
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,966
DID YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

116
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:15,600
NO, NO, I'M FINE.

117
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,366
UM, TIME OF DEATH, 3:49.

118
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,032
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!

119
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,466
DO YOU KNOW ME?

120
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,233
WAIT!

121
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:38,066
Mrs. Morrison:
HOW IS DIANA?

122
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,199
WHEN CAN I SEE HER?

123
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,133
ANSWER ME!

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,900
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!

125
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,773
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?

126
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,433
WHEN CAN I SEE HER?

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,266
YOUR DAUGHTER SUFFERED
A BLOOD CLOT IN HER LUNG.

128
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:55,166
I'M VERY SORRY. WE DID
EVERYTHING WE COULD,

129
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:56,833
BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE
TO REVIVE YOUR DAUGHTER,

130
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,199
AND SHE DIED.
NO, NO!

131
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:01,133
NOT DIANA!

132
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,999
NO! NOT MY LITTLE GIRL!

133
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,400
NO! SHE CAN'T-

134
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,466
IS THERE ANYONE
WE CAN CALL?

135
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,032
A SPOUSE,
ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER?

136
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,867
NO, IT'S JUST ME AND DIANA.

137
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:18,233
I'M SORRY.

138
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,500
NO...

139
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,366
NO, LET'S GO.

140
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,633
MOM, SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANYONE!

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,733
WE'RE PROBABLY JUST
MAKING IT WORSE.

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,366
COME ON, WE DON'T
BELONG HERE.

143
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,066
IS DIANA HERE?

144
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,800
YEAH.

145
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,433
SHE'S WITH HER MOM.

146
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,199
I THINK SHE WANTED TO SAY
GOODBYE BEFORE MOVING ON.

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,166
OR MAYBE NOT.

151
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,534
IT'S CRAZY.

152
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,868
IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE.
I KNOW.

153
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:35,534
16 YEARS OLD,
WAY TOO YOUNG.

154
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,134
IS ELI TALKING
TO THE KIDS?

155
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,667
YEAH, NED SAYS
HE'S HELPING A LOT.

156
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,467
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
SUGGESTING HIM FOR THAT.

157
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,201
HE'S A GOOD THERAPIST.
HE REALLY LISTENS.

158
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,201
WELL, WHEN YOU TOLD ME HOW IMPORTANT
DIANA AND HER MOM WERE TO EVERYONE-

159
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:48,801
OOH, LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND.

160
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,068
YEAH, ALL THE KIDS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

161
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,301
USED TO GO OVER THERE
AND PLAY.

162
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,567
THEY JUST HAD ONE OF
THOSE HOMES, YOU KNOW,

163
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,634
VERY WARM AND INVITING.
EVERYONE LOVED THEM.

164
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,134
EXCEPT FOR OLIVIA'S MOM,
FROM WHAT I SAW.

165
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,434
I JUST DON'T
GET THAT.

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,268
WELL, IT SEEMED MUTUAL.

167
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,934
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
IT'S JUST BECAUSE

168
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,567
CYNTHIA WAS WORRIED
ABOUT HER DAUGHTER.

169
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,801
NO, IT SEEMED LIKE
SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

170
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:09,467
I MEAN, NED SAID THAT THE DAUGHTER
WAS CHILLY WITH OLIVIA AT THE COURT.

171
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,968
SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN
FEELING SICK, YOU KNOW?

172
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,901
YEAH, MAYBE,
BUT IT DIDN'T END THERE.

173
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:16,834
MEANING?

174
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,567
WHAT? WAS THERE A GHOST?

175
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:23,601
DID YOU SEE DIANA?

176
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:24,834
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO KNOW THAT?

177
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:27,068
ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN
THINKING A SPIRIT THAT YOUNG

178
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,834
WOULD JUST VANISH!

179
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,801
HI.
HI.

180
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,168
SHE DIDN'T VANISH. I
SAW HER AT THE HOSPITAL.

181
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:34,834
WELL, DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?

182
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:38,400
I MEAN, DID SHE GO
INTO THE LIGHT OR WHATEVER?

183
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,634
IMPRESSIVE! NO, SHE WENT
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

184
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,801
SHE FOLLOWED OLIVIA
AND HER MOM HOME.

185
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:44,201
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

186
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,467
MMM, MY EXPERIENCE?

187
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:47,534
NOTHING GOOD.

188
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,767
WHAT CAN I SAY?

189
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:08,667
MOM, DAD,
ARE YOU BACK?

190
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:16,168
HELLO?

191
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:18,434
IS SOMEONE HERE?

192
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,834
HELLO?!

193
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,268
IS SOMEONE HERE?

194
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,434
HELLO? MR. OR MRS. KELLER, PLEASE.

195
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,201
CAN I SPEAK TO MR.
OR MRS. KELLER? HELLO?

196
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,801
NO, THEY'RE NOT
IN RIGHT NOW.

197
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,068
CAN I TAKE
A MESSAGE?

198
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:36,701
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
WHO'S CALLING?

199
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,734
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

200
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,335
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE
COULD DO, MRS. MORRISON...

201
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,634
JUST DON'T BE STRANGERS.

202
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,634
MY HOME WILL ALWAYS
BE OPEN TO YOU KIDS.

203
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:19,034
TECHNO SPOOK
BY THE COMPUTER.

204
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,467
SCARY.

205
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,168
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

206
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,934
OLIVIA WAS TELLING
SOME OF HER GIRLFRIENDS

207
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,534
THIS MORNING
AT ASSEMBLY.

208
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:27,101
I'M REALLY SORRY,
MRS. MORRISON.

209
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,101
IS THAT OLIVIA
WITH DIANA'S MOM?

210
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,667
YEAH.

211
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:32,201
WOW.

212
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,134
WELL, THAT DIDN'T SEEM
TO GO VERY WELL.

213
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,034
LET'S GO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

214
00:10:58,634 --> 00:10:59,834
OLIVIA?

215
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:01,968
HI.

216
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,268
MY NAME IS ELI JAMES.

217
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:05,701
I'M A THERAPIST
OVER AT ROCKLAND U.

218
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,667
I WAS ASKED
TO COME HERE TODAY

219
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,068
TO SPEAK TO YOUR FELLOW
SCHOOLMATES ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

220
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:13,034
YEAH, I'VE SEEN YOU AROUND.

221
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,001
NED SAID, UH, YOU TWO WERE
THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED?

222
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,235
YEAH, WHATEVER IT WAS.

223
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,068
DOES ANYONE KNOW
HOW SHE GOT SICK LIKE THAT?

224
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,868
I HAVEN'T HEARD
ANYTHING YET.

225
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,868
Ned: WHEN'S
THAT PICTURE FROM?

226
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,634
IT'S YOU AND DIANA,
RIGHT?

227
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,268
YEAH, WE WERE,
LIKE, 7 OR 8.

228
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,434
SEE THAT CAST ON HER LEG?

229
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,868
SHE JUST HAD
HER ANKLE SURGERY,

230
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,335
AND I SIGNED HER CAST
RIGHT THERE, "OK."

231
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,367
MY IRONIC INITIALS.

232
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:43,434
YOU SAID YOU AND DIANA
USED TO BE FRIENDS?

233
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,034
YEAH, THE FIRST TIME
I LIVED IN GRANDVIEW.

234
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,634
IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

235
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:50,968
OLIVIA, I DO THIS A LOT,

236
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,534
AND I PROMISE YOU,

237
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,268
IF YOU'RE FEELING BAD
ABOUT SOMETHING,

238
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:57,667
TALKING ABOUT IT
ALWAYS MAKES IT BETTER.

239
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,101
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE, OUR
MOMS WERE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS

240
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:09,601
THAT WE DID
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

241
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,567
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
WE WERE SISTERS.

242
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,868
WITH PLAY DATES AND SPORTS
AND CAMPING.

243
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,335
WE EVEN HAVE
THE SAME BIRTHDAY,

244
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,001
SO OUR PARTIES WERE LIKE THIS
WHOLE BIG DEAL EVERY YEAR.

245
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,367
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

246
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,400
IT JUST ENDED.

247
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,667
I REMEMBER ONE NIGHT
I WOKE UP,

248
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:26,301
AND MY MOM WAS IN BED WITH
ME, AND SHE WAS ROCKING ME,

249
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,534
JUST CRYING AND CRYING.

250
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,634
I ASKED HER
WHAT WAS WRONG,

251
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,034
BUT ALL SHE WOULD SAY
WAS THAT SHE LOVED ME.

252
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:35,801
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

253
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,968
DIANA'S MOM AND DAD SPLIT UP,

254
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,667
WE STOPPED HANGING OUT
WITH THEM,

255
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:41,068
AND THEN WE GOT
TRANSFERRED TO TEXAS.

256
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,634
OR MY DAD, SO WE LEFT.

257
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,101
DID YOU AND DIANA
KEEP IN TOUCH?

258
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,134
WE TRIED,
OR AT LEAST I DID.

259
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,201
I WROTE HER AND STUFF,
BUT SHE NEVER WROTE ME BACK.

260
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,567
I GUESS DIANA MADE
NEW FRIENDS.

261
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,068
MY MOM SAID
THAT I SHOULD, TOO.

262
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,201
SHE TOLD ME
TO FORGET ABOUT HER.

263
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,634
IT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

264
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,934
IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS
MAD AT HER, TOO.

265
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,667
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
YOUR DAD GOT TRANSFERRED BACK?

266
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:03,767
SHE DIDN'T
WRITE ME IN 8 YEARS.

267
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,034
I MEAN, WHY WOULD SHE WANT
TO BE MY FRIEND NOW?

268
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,434
SHE DIDN'T NEED ME
WHEN SHE HAD ALL OF THIS.

269
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,168
WHAT'S DAD DOING HERE?
THANKS FOR COMING, KEVIN.

270
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,834
EXCUSE ME, I BETTER GO.

271
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:36,268
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

272
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:37,968
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK,

273
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,235
QUACKS LIKE
A DUCK...

274
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,335
Melinda: GET YOUR MIND
OUT OF THE GUTTER.

275
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,567
SHE PULLED HIM ASIDE,
SHE HUGGED HIM,

276
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,335
SHE WHISPERED
SWEET NOTHINGS...

277
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,767
IT WAS A PRAYER VIGIL.
WHO DIDN'T SHE HUG?

278
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,901
FORGET MY MASTERS IN
CLINICAL PSYCH FOR A MINUTE,

279
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:51,434
WHICH I'D LIKE TO FORGET 'CAUSE
I'M STILL PAYING OFF THE LOANS,

280
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,834
AND LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

281
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,934
WHAT EVIDENCE?

282
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,634
TWO WOMEN WHO USED
TO BE BEST FRIENDS

283
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,168
SUDDENLY
BECOME ENEMIES

284
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,734
AND DON'T GIVE
THEIR KIDS A REASON.

285
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,101
YEAH, BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN THE GHOST'S WEIRD BEHAVIOR

286
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,567
AT THE HOSPITAL,

287
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,534
OR FOLLOWING
THE WRONG FAMILY HOME.

288
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:08,034
MAYBE DIANA KNEW ABOUT
THE AFFAIR BEFORE SHE DIED.

289
00:14:08,101 --> 00:14:10,534
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE
WAS SO NASTY TO OLIVIA

290
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,367
AT THE TENNIS COURTS, AND THEN
WENT TO HER HOUSE TO HAUNT HER.

291
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:16,101
UNLESS...

292
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:17,801
UNLESS?

293
00:14:17,868 --> 00:14:21,434
DIANA FOUND SOMETHING OUT AT THE
HOSPITAL THAT PROVED MORE THAN THE AFFAIR.

294
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,634
WHAT IF SHE FOUND OUT SOMETHING
THAT PROVED EVERYTHING?

295
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:26,901
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO BUY A VOWEL.

296
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:29,634
OK, WHAT IF OLIVIA'S DAD
WAS HER DAD, TOO,

297
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,634
AND SHE FOUND THAT OUT
IN THE HOSPITAL RECORDS?

298
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:34,201
WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY HE WAS AT THE VIGIL.

299
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,868
I MEAN, IF HE LOST
A DAUGHTER, TOO...

300
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:37,601
YEAH, AND WHY DIANA
WENT HOME WITH THE KELLERS

301
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,567
INSTEAD OF HER OWN MOM.

302
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:42,601
OLIVIA COULD BE
THE HALF-SISTER

303
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,901
SHE NEVER KNEW SHE HAD.
OR WANTED.

304
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,601
MAKING OLIVIA'S DAD...

305
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,701
THE MAN WHO RUINED EVERYTHING.

306
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,601
HEY, KIDDO.

307
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,068
OH, GOD, YOU STARTLED ME.

308
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:04,434
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

309
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,467
I CAN'T SLEEP AGAIN.

310
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,235
THINKING ABOUT DIANA?

311
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:14,335
UM, MOM WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HER.

312
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,634
I KNOW THAT WE WEREN'T FRIENDS
AT THE END, BUT SHE DIED.

313
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:19,534
WHAT HAPPENED, DAD?

314
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:22,068
I MEAN, WITH MOM
AND MRS. M.

315
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:25,301
HOW CAN MOM BE SO COLD
TO HER, ESPECIALLY NOW?

316
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,068
IF YOU KNOW,
PLEASE TELL ME.

317
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,934
HONEY, I JUST THINK THAT...

318
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:32,268
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THERE'S
A LITTLE GUILT, 'CAUSE...

319
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,901
WE STILL HAVE YOU.

320
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,968
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

321
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:41,601
IT'S THE SAME NOISE THAT
I HEARD THE OTHER NIGHT.

322
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,934
IT'S COMING FROM UPSTAIRS.
IT'S THE ATTIC.

323
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,400
WAIT HERE, OK?

324
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,335
NO WAY.

325
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,168
DAD, I'M SCARED.

326
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,467
DON'T WORRY, HONEY. IT'S PROBABLY
JUST RATS IN THE RAT TRAPS.

327
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:57,901
THOSE ARE NO RATS.

328
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:06,400
THAT'S STRANGE.

329
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,534
DAD!
HONEY, ARE YOU OK?

330
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,500
YEAH!

331
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:25,068
WHOA!

332
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,167
IT'S DIANA, I KNOW IT IS.

333
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:40,767
MY DAD CLAIMS THAT THERE'S SOME
SORT OF REASONABLE EXPLANATION,

334
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,633
ALTHOUGH HE SURE ISN'T
COMING UP WITH ONE.

335
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,867
SO WHAT IS
HE SAYING?

336
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:46,267
NOT TO TELL MY MOTHER.

337
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,201
HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT
TO WORRY HER.

338
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:49,434
BUT HE WENT TO WORK,
AND MY MOM'S OUT,

339
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,733
AND I'M SO SCARED.
SHE KEEPS DOING IT!

340
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,534
I PUT THEM AWAY
SO MANY TIMES,

341
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,234
AND SHE KEEPS
BRINGING THEM BACK OUT.

342
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:58,700
DIANA DID THIS.

343
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,334
YOU BELIEVE ME?

344
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,301
YES.

345
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,900
WE BOTH DO.

346
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:07,034
WHY?

347
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,534
BECAUSE I CAN
SEE SPIRITS.

348
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,334
I'VE SEEN DIANA'S.

349
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,167
I WATCHED HER FOLLOW YOU
HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.

350
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,501
THAT'S WHY NED WANTED
YOU TO MEET WITH ME.

351
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,501
DO THE PHOTOS
ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS?

352
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,534
YEAH, EACH TIME I
FOUND THEM THE SAME WAY.

353
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,134
STARTING WITH PHOTOS OF
MY MOM AND DAD GROWING UP,

354
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,568
THEIR WEDDING, AND ALL OF MY
BABY PHOTOS UP THROUGH NOW.

355
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,700
IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE FAMILY
HISTORY LAID OUT IN PHOTOS.

356
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,034
AND THEN THERE'S
THE PHONE CALLS.

357
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,000
PHONE CALLS?
YEAH, IT RINGS,

358
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,700
I ANSWER, AND I CAN HEAR
SOMEONE TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.

359
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,534
DOES IT SOUND
LIKE DIANA'S VOICE?

360
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,633
NO, IT SOUNDED LIKE A WOMAN,
BUT IT'S TOTALLY GARBLED.

361
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,134
AND THEN IT'S CUT OFF
BY THIS AWFUL SCREECHING SOUND.

362
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:45,934
UM, WHERE'S YOUR TELEPHONE?

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,534
IT'S IN THE KITCHEN.

364
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,334
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE CALLER I.D.

365
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:57,334
OK, SO YOU SAID THAT THE LAST
INTERRUPTED CALL CAME IN...

366
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:58,867
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

367
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,534
GOT IT.

368
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,234
NO! IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

369
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,234
IT'S OK. WE'RE HERE.

370
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:20,000
SHE'S GONE.

371
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,201
WHY DOES DIANA CARE
ABOUT ME AND MY FAMILY?

372
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,867
I DON'T KNOW.

373
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:26,568
BUT I THINK I KNOW
SOMEONE WHO DOES.

374
00:18:26,633 --> 00:18:28,633
DR. TRAVIS,
YOU HAVE A VISITOR

375
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,234
IN THE MAIN LOBBY.

376
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,667
HI. I'M LOOKING FOR A NURSE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HER NAME.

377
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,034
SHE WAS WORKING THE E.R.
WHEN THAT HIGH SCHOOL KID DIED,

378
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:37,101
DIANA MORRISON.

379
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,568
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

380
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,534
WELL, IT WAS JUST
A TOUGH DAY,

381
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,568
AND SO I WANTED TO THANK HER
FOR REACHING OUT TO THE FAMILY.

382
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,000
HER NAME IS PERRY,
DOROTHY PERRY.

383
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,700
I'M SURE SHE'D APPRECIATE
IT, IF SHE WERE HERE,

384
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,401
I KNOW SHE WAS TRYING
TO MAKE SOME COPIES,

385
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:50,800
AND A PHONE CALL,
AND...

386
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,401
NOTHING WAS
WORKING FOR HER.

387
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:54,067
IS THERE A COPIER NEARBY?

388
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,067
UM, THE RECORDS ROOM
ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

389
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,134
GREAT. THANK YOU.

390
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,234
WHAT ON EARTH?!
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!

391
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,733
HELLO?
ANYBODY THERE?

392
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,434
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

393
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,434
HEY!

394
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:45,034
WAIT, NURSE PERRY!

395
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,534
NURSE PERRY!
NO, I CAN'T!

396
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,434
I JUST WANT TO TALK!

397
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,800
OH, MY GOD! PLEASE, SOMEBODY, HELP ME!

398
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,000
HELP!

399
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,232
HEY.

400
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,900
THE WORD IS, SHE'S GOING
TO BE OUT FOR A WHILE.

401
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,566
THEY'VE GOT HER ON
HEAVY PAINKILLERS

402
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,700
AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDS.

403
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,933
DID YOU GET
ANYTHING ELSE?

404
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,733
OH, YEAH. SHE GOT
WORKED OVER PRETTY GOOD.

405
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,332
HEAD LACERATION,
2 BROKEN RIBS,

406
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,433
HAIRLINE FRACTURE
OF HER COLLARBONE.

407
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,733
DIANA WAS
SO ANGRY AT HER.

408
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,150
YEAH, MEL, HOW WAS AN E.R.
NURSE INVOLVED IN THIS?

409
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:40,960
I THINK SHE WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH OLIVIA'S FAMILY

410
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,966
TRYING TO TELL THEM
SOMETHING.

411
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,433
WHEN I SAW HER, SHE WAS
COMING OUT OF THE RECORD ROOM.

412
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:47,700
MELINDA, COME ON, IT'S ONE
THING TO GO ASKING AROUND

413
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,133
ABOUT A MEDICAL CONDITION,
IT'S ANOTHER TO-

414
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,332
YEAH, BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAUSED DIANA'S DEATH!

415
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:53,199
I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS IN
THOSE RECORDS. THOSE ARE OLD RECORDS.

416
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,199
MAYBE IT WAS
SOMETHING ELSE.

417
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,900
MAYBE SOMETHING
IN DIANA'S PAST

418
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,199
THAT THE DOCTOR
SHOULD HAVE SEEN.

419
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,332
MAYBE THEY MADE
A MISTAKE.

420
00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:00,800
I MEAN, SHE WAS A
HEALTHY 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

421
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:02,133
OK, THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE,

422
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,666
WHY IS THE GHOST HAUNTING
OLIVIA AND HER FAMILY?

423
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,499
I DON'T KNOW.

424
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,700
THE GIRL IS DEAD,
A WOMAN IS HURT,

425
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,466
AND I AM OUT
OF THEORIES.

426
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,466
PLEASE.

427
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:13,033
ALL I NEED
IS 10 MINUTES.

428
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,833
HERE'S M.

429
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:32,966
MOORE, MORIARTY.
WHERE'S MORRISON?

430
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,633
MISSING.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

431
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,633
THESE MUST BE WAITING
TO BE RE-FILED.

432
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,000
THERE YOU GO.

433
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,133
HER MEDICAL RECORDS.

434
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,666
THESE ARE FROM LIKE
8 YEARS AGO.

435
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:47,067
OH, LOOKS LIKE SHE HAD
AN OPERATION.

436
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,499
FRACTURED HER ANKLE.

437
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:53,332
AND DIANA'S BIRTH RECORD.

438
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,833
MR. KELLER'S NOT LISTED
AS HER FATHER.

439
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,332
WHY WOULD A NURSE
WANT COPIES OF THIS STUFF?

440
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,566
WAIT A MINUTE, THIS
IS WEIRD. LOOK AT THIS.

441
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,666
HER BLOOD TYPE
ON HER SURGERY RECORD

442
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,067
DOESN'T MATCH HER BLOOD
TYPE ON HER BIRTH RECORD.

443
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,566
A.B., O.

444
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:12,033
DO HOSPITALS
MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT?

445
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,599
IT'S POSSIBLE,
BUT RARE.

446
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,399
OR MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.

447
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,300
????

448
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,133
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE ANGRY,

449
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:45,533
BUT I THINK SHE WAS
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

450
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,800
SHE WANTED THE TRUTH
TO COME OUT.

451
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,866
THERE ARE SOME MISTAKES
THAT YOU CAN'T FIX!

452
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,266
I FOUND THAT OUT
THE DAY THAT I DIED.

453
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,366
ANSWER ME!

454
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,933
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,933
I FOLLOWED HER
TO THE RECORDS ROOM.

456
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,666
AND RIGHT AWAY,
I SAW SOMETHING WEIRD.

457
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,366
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

458
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:26,232
AND THAT'S WHEN I
REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED.

459
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,566
OLIVIA AND I WERE
SWITCHED AT BIRTH.

460
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:29,866
THE BLOOD TYPES
DIDN'T MATCH, I KNOW.

461
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:32,566
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS
REALLY UPSETTING HER.

462
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,299
SHE LOOKED SO GUILTY!

463
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:36,766
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

464
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,933
LIKE SHE HAD
DONE SOMETHING AWFUL.

465
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,633
YOU WERE THERE THE DAY
I WAS BORN, TOO?

466
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,067
AND THAT'S WHEN
IT HIT ME-

467
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,000
IT WAS HER MISTAKE.

468
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,966
THAT'S HOW SHE KNEW
TO LOOK IN THOSE FILES.

469
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,933
IT'S HER FAULT!

470
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,332
LOOK,
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

471
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,100
BUT I...

472
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,800
I THINK IT WAS JUST
A MISTAKE, YOU KNOW?

473
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,733
A STUPID ACCIDENT.

474
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,399
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S STUPID?

475
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,199
HOW COULD I
NOT HAVE KNOWN?!

476
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:10,100
I MEAN, WE EVEN HAVE
THE SAME BIRTHDAY!

477
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,633
AND MY-SO CALLED
FAMILY?

478
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,299
MY MOM IS BLONDE,
BLUE-EYED,

479
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,533
A SEMI-PRO
TENNIS PLAYER.

480
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,466
SO I ALWAYS TOLD MYSELF
THAT I SUCKED AT TENNIS

481
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:22,366
BECAUSE I TOOK AFTER
MY DAD.

482
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,299
WELL, IT TURNS OUT,

483
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:25,966
I DO TAKE AFTER
MY MOM,

484
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,666
I JUST HAD
THE WRONG ONE.

485
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,232
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THIS IS
PAINFUL, BUT I CAN HELP YOU,

486
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,800
TALK TO YOUR MOM,
YOUR BIRTH FAMILY.

487
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:33,833
NO! THEY CAN'T KNOW.

488
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,766
WELL, I THINK
YOU NEED THEM TO.

489
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,067
THAT'S WHY YOU WENT TO
THE KELLER'S HOUSE, RIGHT?

490
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:40,232
SO THAT YOU COULD RECONNECT
WITH THE FAMILY YOU CAME FROM?

491
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:43,700
YOU NEED TO MAKE PEACE WITH
THIS SO THAT YOU CAN MOVE ON.

492
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:47,167
THAT WOMAN'S MISTAKE HAS
CAUSED ENOUGH DAMAGE ALREADY.

493
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:49,232
WELL, YOU DON'T
CONTROL THAT ANYMORE.

494
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,399
I KNOW THAT'S UPSETTING, BUT-

495
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,499
TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT NURSE

496
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:54,766
AND TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND I CAN'T DO.

497
00:24:56,466 --> 00:25:00,499
I WILL DO WHATEVER
I HAVE TO DO.

498
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,533
NO ONE CAN FIND OUT.

499
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,266
HI, MS. PERRY.

500
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,667
UM, MY NAME
IS MELINDA GORDON

501
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:18,833
AND I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU,

502
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,133
IF YOU'RE FEELING
UP TO IT.

503
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:23,300
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CAME
LOOKING FOR ME WHEN I FELL?

504
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:24,733
YES.

505
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,366
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME
INFORMATION ON DIANA MORRISON,

506
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:31,466
AND NOW I COULDN'T BE
MORE CERTAIN THAT YOU DO.

507
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:33,567
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

508
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,000
THE DAY THAT DIANA
WAS BORN.

509
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,133
I KNOW THAT SHE WAS
SWITCHED WITH OLIVIA KELLER.

510
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,034
LOOK, I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE SCARED.

511
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,767
A LOT OF REALLY STRANGE
THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO YOU,

512
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,000
BUT TRUST ME-

513
00:25:45,066 --> 00:25:47,700
THEY WON'T END UNTIL
YOU ADMIT WHAT YOU DID.

514
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:49,967
<i>WHAT I DID?</i>

515
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:51,366
NO! I-

516
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,767
I WAS THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENED,

517
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:59,466
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO SWITCHED THOSE GIRLS.

518
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,533
OK, THE DAY THAT
DIANA MORRISON WAS BORN,

519
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,034
THERE'D BEEN THIS HUGE ACCIDENT
ON THE INTERSTATE.

520
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,500
WE WERE UNDERSTAFFED
AND OVERWHELMED.

521
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,615
THE BRACELET MUST HAVE
COME OFF IN THE BATH.

522
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
THE CHARGE NURSE
SEEMS CONFUSED.

523
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,034
UM, IS EVERYTHING OK?

524
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,667
YOU WERE SENT
TO ROOM 214.

525
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,333
YOU GOT TO GET MRS. KELLER
UP AND WALKING. GO, NOW!

526
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,233
I WAS FRESH
OUT OF NURSING SCHOOL.

527
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,500
I WAS TRYING TO LEARN WITHOUT
ASKING TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

528
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,333
WHAT COULD I DO?

529
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,733
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROOF.

530
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,633
IT WAS JUST A FEELING.

531
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,934
BUT I DID REMEMBER
THOSE GIRLS' NAMES.

532
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,099
THEN I SAW
THE MOTHERS BONDING

533
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,900
AND TALKING IN THE HALLWAYS,

534
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,066
AND...

535
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,433
CRADLING THEIR BABIES.

536
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,700
AND THEN YOU SAW THEM
AGAIN 16 YEARS LATER.

537
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:16,567
I RECOGNIZED HER NAME WHEN
THE PARAMEDICS BROUGHT HER IN.

538
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:17,867
DO WE HAVE HER NAME?

539
00:27:17,934 --> 00:27:19,600
DIANA MORRISON.

540
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,066
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF HER DEATH,

541
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:22,366
THE BLOOD CLOT,

542
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,900
IT MADE ME WONDER
ALL OVER AGAIN.

543
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:28,066
SO I PULLED THE GIRL'S
MEDICAL RECORDS.

544
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,466
THAT'S WHAT CONFIRMED IT.

545
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,767
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
CONTACT THE FAMILIES EVER SINCE.

546
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:37,900
IT'S JUST THAT SOME...

547
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:41,600
SOMETHING JUST...
DOESN'T WANT TO LET...

548
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

549
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,099
LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE OK.

550
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,166
YOU SUSPECTED
FOR 16 YEARS.

551
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,066
I NEED TO KNOW WHY YOU'RE SO
DETERMINED TO TELL THEM NOW.

552
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:55,733
BECAUSE THE BLOOD CLOT
THAT KILLED DIANA

553
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,433
WAS A GENETIC CONDITION.

554
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
IT COULD AFFECT SOMEONE ELSE
IN HER BIOLOGICAL FAMILY.

555
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,733
THEY HAVE TO BE TOLD.

556
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,700
WOW.

557
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,900
THAT'S A TOUGH ONE,
EVEN FOR YOU.

558
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,366
I HAVE TO TELL THEM,
OBVIOUSLY.

559
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:14,233
I MEAN THE KELLERS NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THE DISEASE,

560
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,199
AND THEN CYNTHIA MORRISON'S
GOING TO FIND OUT.

561
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:18,333
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

562
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,900
TO THE GHOST
OR THE FAMILIES.

563
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,767
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

564
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,533
I MEAN,
MOURNING YOUR CHILD,

565
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,934
ONLY TO FIND OUT
SHE ISN'T YOURS.

566
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,767
AND THEN THE CHILD
THAT IS YOURS,

567
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,333
BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE.

568
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,767
OLIVIA'S PARENTS, TOO.

569
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,034
I MEAN, THEIR BIRTH CHILD
IS DEAD.

570
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:36,967
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO GET
TO KNOW HER AS THEIRS.

571
00:28:37,034 --> 00:28:40,466
I GUESS THAT'S WHY DIANA'S
BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD

572
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,066
TO KEEP THIS ALL A SECRET.

573
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,667
IT'S ALL JUST TO PROTECT
EVERYONE FROM THE BIG BOMBSHELL.

574
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,733
WHO DO YOU TELL FIRST?

575
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,333
I THINK I HAVE TO START
WITH THE WOMAN WHO RAISED HER.

576
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,633
SO KIND OF YOU
TO BRING THIS BY.

577
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,633
I THINK EVERYONE
MISSES DIANA.

578
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
I KNOW
THAT NED DOES.

579
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,266
OH, HE'S A SWEET BOY.

580
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,733
IS THAT HOW YOU KNOW
MY DAUGHTER, THROUGH NED?

581
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,934
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

582
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,867
I WARNED YOU
NOT TO DO THIS!

583
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:14,567
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
DIANA WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

584
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:16,099
HMM.

585
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,667
BUT I'VE TALKED
TO HER RECENTLY.

586
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,099
UM...

587
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:23,533
I SEE EARTHBOUND
SPIRITS.

588
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,934
THAT'S HOW I KNOW
THAT DIANA'S HERE.

589
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,233
I CAME HERE BECAUSE
SHE'S NOT AT PEACE,

590
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,333
AND THERE'S A REASON
WHY SHE CAN'T MOVE ON.

591
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,934
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

592
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,767
NO, THIS IS...

593
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,433
IT'S VERY REAL.

594
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,867
DIANA'S BEEN TRYING TO
PROTECT YOU FROM SOMETHING,

595
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,333
BUT I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW,

596
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,833
BECAUSE IT'S GOING
TO COME OUT EVENTUALLY.

597
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,833
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO DO THIS!

598
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,199
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE?!

599
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:49,266
I SPOKE TO A NURSE
AT MERCY HOSPITAL,

600
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,567
DOROTHY PERRY.

601
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:52,867
SHE WAS THERE THE DAY
THAT DIANA DIED,

602
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,600
AND THE DAY
THAT SHE WAS BORN.

603
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,867
THE SAME DAY THAT
OLIVIA KELLER WAS BORN.

604
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,199
STOP IT! STOP!

605
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,533
WHY IS THIS SUDDENLY
COMING OUT NOW?

606
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,967
WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT ALL THIS?

607
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,500
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

608
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:15,366
MMM, I HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD FEELING.

609
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:16,900
WHAT?!

610
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,633
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?

611
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,733
I SAW A BLOOD PANEL

612
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,466
FROM THE ANKLE SURGERY
SHE HAD WHEN SHE WAS 8.

613
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,133
IS THAT WHEN YOU
REALIZED THE TRUTH?

614
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,099
NO, IT WAS LONG BEFORE THAT.

615
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,233
I'VE KNOWN DIANA
WASN'T MINE

616
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,767
ALMOST AS LONG
AS I'VE HAD HER.

617
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,400
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

618
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,466
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.

619
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,767
PLEASE.

620
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,700
I HAD A LONG LABOR,

621
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,066
AND SO DID LISA KELLER.

622
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:51,099
WE MET WALKING THE HALLS,

623
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:52,967
PASSING THE TIME TOGETHER,

624
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,667
WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN.

625
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,967
BOTH HAVING GIRLS,
EXCITED.

626
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:00,900
AND WE JUST BECAME FRIENDS.

627
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:04,500
THERE'S SO MUCH JOY.

628
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,833
AND THEN
WHAT HAPPENED?

629
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,800
THEN I BROUGHT DIANA HOME,
AND SOMETHING FELT OFF.

630
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:16,133
EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS
POST-PARTUM DEPRESSION,

631
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,099
AND AT FIRST, SO DID I.

632
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:21,133
I MEAN,
I LOVE MY LITTLE GIRL.

633
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:25,199
BUT THAT FEELING
DIDN'T GO AWAY.

634
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:29,166
SO, WHEN DID YOU
SUSPECT

635
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:30,867
THAT DIANA
WASN'T YOUR BABY?

636
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,000
AS THEY STARTED
TO GROW OLDER,

637
00:31:33,066 --> 00:31:34,767
I STARTED TO NOTICE
SIMILARITIES

638
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,366
BETWEEN ME AND OLIVIA
THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE

639
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,967
WITH DIANA.
WHEN SHE PLAYED TENNIS,

640
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:44,000
SHE PLAYED LIKE ME.
SHE HAD MY MOTHER'S EYES.

641
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:47,233
AND SOMETIMES, WHEN I
LOOKED AT HER AND SHE SMILED,

642
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,466
I FELT LIKE I WAS
LOOKING AT A MIRROR.

643
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,733
WHAT ABOUT WHEN
YOU LOOKED AT ME?

644
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,166
DID YOU CONTACT
LISA KELLER?

645
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:59,366
NOT UNTIL THE PRE-SURGERY
BLOOD WORK CONFIRMED IT.

646
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:00,900
THAT'S WHEN I CALLED LISA.

647
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,266
HOW DID SHE REACT?

648
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,600
SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.

649
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:08,000
REFUSED TO HAVE
OLIVIA TESTED.

650
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,300
SHE CUT OFF ALL CONTACT.

651
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,733
THEY MOVED TO TEXAS.

652
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,533
SHE SAID IT WAS
FOR KEVIN'S JOB.

653
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,300
SHE WAS RUNNING AWAY
FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH.

654
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,833
SO MY OWN MOTHER
DIDN'T WANT ME,

655
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,633
AND YOU COULDN'T
GET RID OF ME?

656
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,800
LET HER EXPLAIN.
SHE ALREADY HAS.

657
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,934
AND IF THEY LOVED
THE TWO OF US SO LITTLE,

658
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,833
THEN THEY WON'T MISS US
WHEN WE'RE BOTH GONE!

659
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,500
WHAT'S GOING ON?

660
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,066
IS, UH, DIANA-

661
00:32:34,133 --> 00:32:37,300
WE NEED TO GO SEE OLIVIA
BEFORE DIANA DOES.

662
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,466
DIANA, STOP IT!

663
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:31,334
WHAT IS IT?!

664
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,434
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

665
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,344
????

666
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,133
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, DIANA?

667
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,866
MRS. KELLER?

668
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:47,866
YES?

669
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,467
MY NAME IS MELINDA GORDON.

670
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,699
IS YOUR DAUGHTER HOME?

671
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:54,000
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

672
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,766
TRUST HER, LISA.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

673
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:05,500
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAPPENED?

674
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,766
WHO-

675
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,033
WHO DID ALL OF THIS?
LIVVY? SWEETIE?

676
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,666
OLIVIA?

677
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,833
HER BACKPACK IS NOT HERE.

678
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,500
OR HER CELL PHONE,
CLOTHES, LAPTOP.

679
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:27,067
OH, MY GOD!

680
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:28,566
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

681
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:31,067
DID YOU TELL OLIVIA?

682
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,267
NO.

683
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,766
THEN HOW DID SHE KNOW
ABOUT THESE?

684
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,067
HOW DID SHE KNOW
TO EVEN LOOK FOR THESE?

685
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,766
DIANA MUST HAVE
LED HER TO THEM.

686
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,400
WHAT?!

687
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:41,800
THESE ARE ALL LETTERS
FROM DIANA TO OLIVIA.

688
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,267
AND SHE THOUGHT
I NEVER WROTE HER BACK.

689
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,666
HER MOM MUST HAVE
KEPT THEM FROM HER.

690
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,333
YOU KEPT THESE
FROM OLIVIA?

691
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
MY GOD, LISA.

692
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,866
ARE YOU SO SELFISH
THAT YOU WOULDN'T EVEN

693
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:59,666
LET OUR DAUGHTERS
BE FRIENDS?

694
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,900
DIANA'S BABY BRACELET.

695
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:07,100
I SENT THIS TO LISA,
TRYING ONE LAST TIME

696
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,900
AFTER I TOLD HER
THE TRUTH.

697
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,100
AND NOW OLIVIA
KNOWS THE TRUTH.

698
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,699
I HAVE TO FIND HER,
I HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE!

699
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:14,400
NO, YOU DON'T. YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE IS, DON'T YOU?

700
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,599
PLEASE.

701
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,534
OLIVIA NEEDS
YOUR HELP.

702
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,800
SWEETHEART!

703
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,633
OH, I'M SO GLAD
WE FOUND YOU!

704
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,766
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

705
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:43,000
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
ANGRY, BUT, OLIVIA,

706
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,133
YOU HAVE
TO KNOW THAT-

707
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,233
WHAT? WHAT YOU KNEW
FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS?

708
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,500
I FOUND THE LETTER.

709
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:54,766
DEAR LISA, I WANTED YOU TO HAVE
SOMETHING OF YOUR DAUGHTER, DIANA.

710
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:58,800
OLIVIA...

711
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,833
DON'T TALK TO ME, I
CAN'T HEAR ANY MORE LIES!

712
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,100
OLIVIA, DON'T. DON'T TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY.

713
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:05,267
MY MOTHER?
AND WHO ARE YOU?

714
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,300
THE WOMAN
WHO GAVE BIRTH TO ME

715
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:10,599
LET ME PLAY IN THEIR
HOUSE AND THEN LET ME GO?

716
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,633
AND NOT JUST
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE,

717
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,500
BUT HALFWAY ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.

718
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,866
WERE YOU RELIEVED
WHEN WE MOVED?

719
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:19,733
DID THE TWO OF YOU WORK
ALL OF THAT OUT TOGETHER?

720
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,167
SHE TRIED.

721
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:25,167
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
THE TRUTH,

722
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,866
SHE TRIED TO TALK
TO ME, BUT, OLIVIA,

723
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,400
YOU WERE MY DAUGHTER
AND SO WAS DIANA,

724
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,633
AND I COULDN'T
LOSE YOU BOTH!

725
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:34,933
BOTH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

726
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,167
WELL, FROM THE TIME
THEY COULD WALK,

727
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,699
THEY WOULD FOLLOW YOU
EVERYWHERE.

728
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:42,733
PUPPET SHOWS,
GAMES, SPORTS.

729
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,500
KIDS LOVE YOU.

730
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,467
WHAT IF THEY HAD TO CHOOSE?

731
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,699
THEY WOULD BOTH
CHOOSE YOU.

732
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:53,666
LISA, LOOK AT YOUR DAUGHTER.

733
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:57,000
YOUR DAUGHTER OLIVIA.

734
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,500
AS MUCH AS IT KILLS ME
TO SAY THAT.

735
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,766
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S SO ANGRY?

736
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:04,333
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
YOU KEPT THIS FROM HER.

737
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,599
SHE THINKS THIS MEANS
THAT YOU DON'T LOVE HER,

738
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,900
AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE
IN THE WORLD

739
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:11,067
THAT SHE WANTS
THAN YOUR LOVE.

740
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:13,467
WELL, I ALWAYS THOUGHT

741
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:16,167
THERE WAS NOTHING MORE IN
THE WORLD I WANTED THAN HERS.

742
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,500
AND THEN...

743
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:22,033
YOU CALLED ME
THAT DAY,

744
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,900
AND I WANTED MORE.

745
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:29,233
WHENEVER I LOOKED
AT EITHER ONE OF THEM.

746
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,434
OLIVIA, YOU ARE
MY LITTLE GIRL.

747
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,666
NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

748
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:42,367
BUT DIANA, HER HANDS,

749
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,033
HER EYES,

750
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,467
THE WAY SHE WALKED-
SHE WAS MINE, TOO.

751
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:53,067
I'M SORRY

752
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,666
THAT I TORE OUR
DAUGHTERS APART.

753
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:59,300
I'M SORRY THAT I ABANDONED BOTH OF YOU.

754
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,534
HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT
BOTH OF THEM?

755
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,733
I KNOW I DID.

756
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,966
I DON'T WANT THEM
TO HURT ANYMORE.

757
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,900
DIANA WANTS
TO FORGIVE YOU.

758
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,699
WAIT,
DIANA'S HERE?

759
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,067
THAT'S HOW WE FOUND YOU.

760
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:21,467
SHE TOLD ME THAT YOU GUYS
USED TO PLAY HERE TOGETHER.

761
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:25,866
TELL OLIVIA THAT I DID
MAKE NEW FRIENDS, BUT...

762
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,333
THERE WERE NONE LIKE HER.

763
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,067
SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
THAT SHE MISSED YOU.

764
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,267
THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE YOU.

765
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,200
I MISSED HER, TOO.

766
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:38,167
I STILL DO.

767
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,033
SWEETHEART, WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN,

768
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,033
WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ALL OF THIS THROUGH.

769
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,666
WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHERE
TO GO FROM HERE...

770
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:50,267
TOGETHER.

771
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:57,000
SHE'S SAYING GOOD-BYE.

772
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:59,400
OH...

773
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:04,766
WILL SHE BE OK?

774
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,800
SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT

775
00:40:06,866 --> 00:40:09,233
WITHOUT HER.

776
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,400
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE
TO YOU, SWEET GIRL.

777
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,500
NOTHING IS EVER
GOING TO BE THE SAME.

778
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:18,866
REMEMBER WHAT YOU USED
TO TELL ME

779
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,966
WHEN I HAD A BAD DAY

780
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:25,300
OR I DIDN'T DO WELL?

781
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:26,966
YOU WOULD ALWAYS SAY

782
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:30,333
THAT THE ONLY THING
THAT MATTERED TO YOU

783
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,966
IS THAT YOU KNEW
I TRIED MY BEST.

784
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:36,400
THAT'S WHAT
I NEED YOU TO DO.

785
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,599
I NEED YOU TO TRY TO BE OK.

786
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,033
FOR ME.

787
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
SHE WANTS YOU TO TRY.

788
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:51,200
JUST LIKE YOU USED
TO TELL HER TO DO.

789
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:55,666
SHE NEEDS YOU TO PROMISE
THAT YOU'LL AT LEAST TRY.

790
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:01,467
I WILL, SWEET GIRL.

791
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:05,000
I'LL TRY.

792
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,434
SHE'S GONE.

793
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,133
THANK YOU.

794
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,300
LONG DAY?

795
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,500
OH...

796
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:10,133
THE LONGEST.

797
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,167
DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

798
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,267
WHEN I...

799
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:21,333
SAW THOSE TWO MOTHERS

800
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,666
LOVE DAUGHTERS THAT
WEREN'T EVEN REALLY THEIRS,

801
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:27,333
IT JUST MADE ME
REALIZE...

802
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,300
IF WE CAN'T DO THIS...

803
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,267
IF WE CAN'T HAVE
A BABY, WOULD...

804
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:43,133
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
ADOPTION?

805
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,333
ABSOLUTELY.

806
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,900
I REALLY...

807
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:53,300
NEEDED TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT,

808
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:54,633
BECAUSE THE TESTS
AND THE TRYING-

809
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,933
BUT MEL, LOOK AT THIS.

810
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,167
ARE THESE
MY RESULTS?

811
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,167
WELL, I DID RUN INTO
DR. CHEN TODAY.

812
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,599
WELL, WHAT IS THIS
PRESCRIPTION?

813
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,267
IT'S FOR A HORMONE.

814
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,033
IT HELPS THE EMBRYO
ATTACH ITSELF.

815
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,033
IT BASICALLY MAKES IT
FEEL MORE AT HOME

816
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,566
SO IT CAN SETTLE AND GROW.

817
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,866
AND THIS IS
ALL WE NEED?

818
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:17,133
YEAH.

819
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,666
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE A BABY?

820
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:33,912
